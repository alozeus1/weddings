# Image Conventions

- `placeholders/`: temporary visuals for local development and tests.
- `couple/`: final couple portraits and hero images.
- `wedding-party/`: portraits for bridal party and groomsmen.
- `families/`: family portraits and heritage photos.
- `menu/`: menu photography and featured registry thumbnails.

Naming rules:
- lowercase, kebab-case.
- keep stable names referenced by content JSON files.
- replace file content in-place when switching from placeholders to final imagery.
