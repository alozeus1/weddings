      "date": "Online to Long-Distance",
      "body": "Our story started the modern way. Online. One message became daily conversations. Those conversations turned into a real friendship. For four months, we just talked. No pressure. No labels. Just two people genuinely enjoying each other's company. And yes, it was long-distance. Which meant FaceTime dates, countdowns to visits, airport hugs, and 'text me when you land' every single time. Somewhere between the time zones and travel plans, we realized this was no longer just friendship. It was something deeper. So we chose each other, intentionally.",
